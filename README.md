# CoolShopExercise

This is the implementation of the exercise given to me by CoolShop.

## How to run the program

In order to run the program from the terminal, you first need to move into the project folder (the one that contains the `.csproj` file). Then you can start the application with `dotnet run`.

Example:

cd "C:\Users\Andrea.Bellissimo\Desktop\CoolShop\CoolShop"

dotnet run

This ensures that the program finds the required files (such as orderList.csv) in the correct location.
